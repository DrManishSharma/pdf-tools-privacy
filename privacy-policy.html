<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 14, 2026</p>

<p><strong>PDF Tools</strong> ("the App") is developed by Perceptron AI and IT Solutions Inc ("we", "us", or "our"). This privacy policy explains how the App handles your data.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>PDF Tools is designed with privacy as a core principle. The App processes PDF files entirely on your device. We do not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data or files.</p>

<h2>Data Collection</h2>
<p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect any of the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Personal information (name, email, phone number, etc.)</li>
    <li>PDF files or their contents</li>
    <li>Usage analytics or statistics</li>
    <li>Device identifiers or advertising IDs</li>
    <li>Location data</li>
    <li>Browsing or search history</li>
</ul>

<h2>How the App Works</h2>
<p>All PDF processing (merging and splitting) is performed locally on your device. Your files are never uploaded to any server or cloud service. The App does not require an internet connection to perform its core functions.</p>

<h2>Permissions</h2>
<p>The App requests the following permissions:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Storage Access</strong> (Android 12 and below): Required to read and write PDF files on your device. On Android 13 and above, the App uses the system file picker and does not require broad storage permissions.</li>
    <li><strong>Internet Access</strong>: Used solely for Google Play Billing to process optional in-app donations. No user data is transmitted over the internet.</li>
</ul>

<h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
<p>The App offers optional donations through Google Play Billing. These transactions are handled entirely by Google Play. We do not have access to your payment information. Please refer to <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google's Privacy Policy</a> for details on how Google processes payment data.</p>

<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>The App uses the following third-party service:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Google Play Billing</strong> — for processing optional donations. This is the only third-party service used by the App.</li>
</ul>
<p>The App does not include any advertising SDKs, analytics tools, or tracking libraries.</p>

<h2>Data Storage</h2>
<p>The App stores minimal preferences locally on your device (such as whether you have seen the welcome screen). This data is stored using Android's SharedPreferences and never leaves your device.</p>

<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>The App does not collect any personal information from anyone, including children under the age of 13. The App is safe for use by all ages.</p>

<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated "Last updated" date. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>

<h2>Contact Us</h2>
<p>If you have any questions about this privacy policy or the App's practices, please contact us at:</p>
